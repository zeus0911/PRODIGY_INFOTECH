## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Housing Price Prediction using Advanced Linear Regression

#### Description:
Predicting housing prices based on various features using advanced linear regression.

#### Approach:
1. **Data Exploration:** Analyzed dataset to understand features and distribution.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, outliers, and performed feature scaling.
3. **Advanced Linear Regression:** Implemented advanced linear regression models considering regularization techniques (e.g., Ridge, Lasso) to improve accuracy.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated models using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

### Task 2: Customer Segmentation using KMeans Clustering

#### Description:
Segmenting customers based on their behavior using KMeans clustering.

#### Approach:
1. **Data Exploration:** Explored customer data to identify patterns.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and scaled data for clustering.
3. **KMeans Clustering:** Utilized KMeans algorithm to group customers based on common characteristics.
4. **Interpretation:** Analyzed clusters to derive meaningful insights.

### Task 3: Cat-Dog Classification using SVM

#### Description:
Classifying images as either cat or dog using Support Vector Machines (SVM).

#### Approach:
1. **Data Preparation:** Organized and labeled a dataset of cat and dog images.
2. **Feature Extraction:** Extracted relevant features from images.
3. **SVM Model Training:** Trained SVM classifier for image classification.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Assessed model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.

### Task 5: Food Calorie Prediction

#### Description:
Predicting calorie content in food items based on various factors.

#### Approach:
1. **Data Collection:** Gathered a comprehensive dataset with food features.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and standardized data for modeling.
3. **Regression Model:** Implemented a regression model to predict calorie content.
4. **Fine-tuning:** Experimented with hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model.
